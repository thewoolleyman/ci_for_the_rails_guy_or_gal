A. Install VMware
- The /tools/vmware directory has installation packages and a pointer to the URL to sign up for a VMware Evaluation Key.  VMware Player and Server are for windows, and VMWare Fusion is for Mac.  VMware Player is free, but can only play existing VMs, not create new ones.  Recent (2 weeks before RailsConf 2008) trial keys are in this directory, but they may not work.
  - For Windows, install VMware Player or Server.  For server, you will start the client app, and connect to the local server.
  - For Mac, install the VMware fusion .dmg file.

  - Use CI_Completed to see all steps completed
- Extract (unrar) the image using the extract tool: stuffit for mac or winrar for windows
- Open the VM using steps in presentation/screenshots/03_virtual_machine_copy
