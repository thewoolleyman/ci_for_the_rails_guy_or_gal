A. Installing Font
- If you want to use the OpenOffice file instead of the PDF, you will need to install the font.
- Note: The presentation works best under OpenOffice 2.2.1, available under /tools/openoffice
- Copy the FreeSansBold font from /tools/font to the correct location for your system:
  - Win: \WINDOWS\Fonts
  - Mac: /Applications/NeoOffice.app/Contents/share/fonts
  - Linux: /var/lib/openoffice/share/fonts

B. Install VMware
- The /tools/vmware directory has installation packages and license keys for VMware.  VMware Server is for windows, and VMWare Fusion is for Mac.  They are both currently free, but may not be in the future.  The license keys may also expire.  There are also some copies of "old" license keys, and the old version of VMware.
  - For Windows, install VMware Server, both the "installation" and "win32 client" packages.  You will then start the client app, and connect to the local server.
  - For Mac, install the VMware fusion .dmg file.  There was just a new version of VMware Fusion released, but the old version is available in a subdirectory 'just in case'
