  - For Mac, install VMware Fusion
  - For Windows, install the free VMware player, or the VMware server if you want to create new VMs.  VMware player is recommended; VMware Server is more complicated (see details below).
- Install a RAR uncompress utility from /tools
- Uncompress the Virtual Machine /virtual_machines/Ubuntu_With_CI_Downloads.vmwarevm.rar
- Review instructional screenshots for opening a VM copy in /presentation/screenshots/03_virtual_machine_copy

A. Install VMware
- The /tools/vmware directory has installation packages and a pointer to the URL to sign up for a VMware Evaluation Key.  VMware Player and Server are for windows, and VMWare Fusion is for Mac.  VMware Player is free, but can only play existing VMs, not create new ones.  Recent (2 weeks before RailsConf 2008) trial keys are in this directory, but they may not work.
  - For Mac, install the VMware fusion .dmg file.
  - For Windows, install VMware Player, it's the easiest way to open a pre-created VM.  If you want to create VMs from scratch, you'll have to use VMware server, but this is more complicated, and you're mostly on your own.  Important hints: 1) Userid/Password for web ui are your local OS id/pw.  2) To open an existing VM, copy the *.vmwarevm folder to your 'datastore' - find the local directory for this in the "summary" page. 

B. Install VMware Image

B.1 Instructions for starting with an existing VM Image

- Install VMware for your OS from /tools/vmware/...
- Copy desired VM image from /virtual_machines to the VMware 'Virtual Machines' directory
  - Use Ubuntu_With_CI_Downloads to do all the non-download steps yourself
  - Use CI_Completed to see all steps completed
- Extract (unrar) the image using the extract tool: stuffit for mac or winrar for windows
- Open the VM using steps in presentation/screenshots/03_virtual_machine_copy


B.2 Instructions for starting from scratch

-  Download Ubuntu ISO from /tools/ubuntu_cd_iso
- Follow instructions in tutorial and/or screenshots in /presentation/screenshots/01...

C. Completing Tutorial

- Use the Virtual Machine and follow instructions in presentation
- ID/Password are ci/password
